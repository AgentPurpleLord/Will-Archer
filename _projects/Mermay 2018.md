description: "<p>Wanting to get better with my Illustration skills I set out to challenge
  myself. <br>For about 7 days I would come home from a day of animating at work and
  sit down for an hour sketching out mermaids. It proved to be a difficult task that
  was hard to juggle alongside my day job. <br>After a week of doing so I decided
  that if I were to go for the whole month my day work would suffer too much. In the
  end I am left with these sketches and improvements in myself as an artist. The mermaids
  are reminder that it's not good to push yourself too hard and that even though others
  may look like they are miles ahead of you, you are your own person, on your own
  path, progressing at your own pace.</p>"
